Django Employee Management API
This project provides a RESTful API for managing employee records in a Django application. Below is a detailed explanation of how to interact with the API and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard Django project structure, with important directories and files including:

employee_api/: The main Django project directory.
employee/: The Django app directory containing the models, views, serializers, and URLs related to employee management.
manage.py: The Django project management script.
Employee Model
The Employee model defines the structure of employee records in the database. It includes fields such as name, email, age, gender, etc.

REST API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints for CRUD operations on employees:

Create Employee: POST request to /create/: Create a new employee record.
Update Employee: PUT request to /update/employee_id: Update an existing employee record.
Delete Employee: DELETE request to /delete/employee_id: Delete an existing employee record.
Get Employee(s): GET request to /get/: Retrieve details of all employees or a specific employee by ID.
Code Walkthrough
Create Employee (POST Request)
To create a new employee record, send a POST request to the /create/ endpoint with the employee data in the request body. Upon successful creation, the API returns a response containing the newly created employee ID.

Retrieve Employee (GET Request)
To retrieve employee records, send a GET request to the /get/ endpoint. You can retrieve details of all employees or a specific employee by providing their ID as a query parameter.

Update Employee (PUT Request)
To update an existing employee record, send a PUT request to the /update/employee_id endpoint, where employee_id is the ID of the employee you want to update. Provide the updated data in the request body.

Delete Employee (DELETE Request)
To delete an employee record, send a DELETE request to the /delete/employee_id endpoint, where employee_id is the ID of the employee you want to delete.

Usage
You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or by making HTTP requests from your client application. Refer to the examples provided in each section for guidance on how to use each CRUD operation.
